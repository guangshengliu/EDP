# EDP version 0.0.1

### Update content

1. Support orthogonal experimental design. Automatically select the appropriate orthogonal table according to the number of factors and levels.
2. Support experimental data processing. Orthogonal experiment supports range analysis and variance analysis.
3. At present, there is no support for interaction between factors and the level number of factors should be consistent.

### Introduction
